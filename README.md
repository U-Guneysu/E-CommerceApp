## 🛠 Installation
To get started, simply clone the repository and set up the project on your machine:

1. **Clone the repository to your local machine:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/U-Guneysu/E-CommerceApp.git
```

2. **Open the project directory in your terminal.**

### Terminal Commands

Install **Node.js** dependencies:

```bash
npm install --force
```

Start the **JSON Server**:

```bash
json-server --watch public/db.json
```

- This command starts JSON Server and watches the `public/db.json` file. Changes made to this file will automatically update the API. JSON Server runs at `http://localhost:3000` by default, allowing you to interact with your data easily.

## 🚀 How to Use

After setting up the server, open your terminal and type:

```bash
npm run start
```

This command starts the application, and you can access it by navigating to `http://localhost:3001` in your browser.
